# Kakoune Recent Buffers

I would show you suggeted mapping but in the end the functionality is kinda hardcoded,
when firing `show-recent-buffer`, the keys `j`, `k`, `l` and `<semicolon>` will
respectively take you to the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th lats visited buffer

## TODO
  - [ ] remove buffers from list if they are closed
